2. Student.sqlite , studentDB.py , students.csv, README.md

3. This program creates an instance of the students table for testing within the Students database.
The program will fail to run if you force exit without manually droping the students table from the Student database because it will try to make another one with the same name on start up. Be sure to use the exit function when your finished and enjoy the application =)

4.	GeeksforGeeks on Pandas , StackOverflow for output errors (was using {} instead of [] for columns in dataframe and the column names were printing unordered)

5.Run the program to start the application and enter the number of each command you would like to Run
  For best results, run [1] first as it populates the database from the csv and allows some of the other functions to actually work. When finished press [7] to delete the temporary instance of students and close the application.
